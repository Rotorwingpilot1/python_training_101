# Lone Star Development Training - String Data Types
# STRINGS
# Strings are one of the data types that you will see the most. Strings can be created in multiple ways within
# Python. You can use single, double or triple quotes. Generally double quotes are used for string representation and
# single quotes are used for regular expressions, sql, or similar other needs.

# Examples
my_string1 = "Welcome to the Lone Star Development Python Training!"
my_string2 = 'Welcome to Lone Star\'s Development Python Training!'
my_string3 = "Welcome to Lone Star's Development Python Training!"
my_string4 = "Wecome to 'Lone Star'"
my_string5 = "Welcome to \"Lone Star\""
my_string6 = """This is a multi-line string so that it can
                span over several lines in the IDE."""
my_string7 = "This is a string that is going to wrap if it is oversized. This is different than a " \
             "multi-line string in the fact that it can keep on going and going till it is not readable."

print (my_string1)
print (my_string2)
print (my_string3)
print (my_string4)
print (my_string5)
print (my_string6)
print (my_string7)
